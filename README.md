# RelaxLoss - Experiments

This repository is based on the original **RelaxLoss** implementation and paper.
I use it as a **research playground** to reproduce the results and extend the
method to different datasets (e.g., Adult, STL-10, MIMIC-IV) and membership
inference attacks.

⚠️ Note: The code structure is messy and mainly for **personal experiments**,
not for production use. For more information, please read the final report

MIMIC-IV-PROCESSOR include some example scripts on how to process MIMIC data

Relaxloss includes both binary and multi-classification, and MIMIC data processor scripts.

STL-10-Relaxloss includes an independent Attack and Defence platform for relaxloss and baseline.
