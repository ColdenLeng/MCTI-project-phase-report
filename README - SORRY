# RelaxLoss - Personal Experiments

This repository is based on the original **RelaxLoss** implementation and paper.
I use it as a **research playground** to reproduce the results and extend the
method to different datasets (e.g., Adult, STL-10, MIMIC-IV) and membership
inference attacks.

⚠️ Note: The code structure is messy and mainly for **personal experiments**,
not for production use.
